  "readme": "# react-addons\n\nThis is an npm package containing *only* the react addons, and not the full react build\nitself (although it requires it). This will play much more nicely with browserify\nand other build tools than the old `require('react/addons')` style.\n\nThis package is a direct copy/paste of the files in `lib/`, with the paths to `/React` changed\nto require the base `react` module. If this module gets significantly out of date, it should\nbe simple to rebuild using the React source.\n\n`react` is a peerDependency of this module, so it won't add extra cruft to your project\nand will work nicely with browserify.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```js\n\n// Previously, you might access React Addons with this path, which actually\n// returns the entire React library, with addons accessible via the `addons` property.\n// Unfortunately, this can confuse browserify and can add an extra 1MB (unminified)\n// to your build.\nvar React = require('react/addons');\n\n// Now, you can access it this way, separately from React itself, \n// and enjoy the relatively small size (42kb unminified)!\nvar React = require('react');\nvar addons = require('react-addons');\n\n// And the addons are available directly on the module, like so:\nvar classSet = addons.classSet;\n\n// Now, you don't have to worry about changing your require statements\n// throughout your app to use `react/addons`!\n```\n",

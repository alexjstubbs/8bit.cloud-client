Set in a time before the original game, players take the role of a new young Overlord. As he revels in command of the Minions, our trainee tyrant will be able to take his growing pains out on the local fairy tale inhabitants as he protects his castle and lands. Connecting players to the game world in three dimensions, the use of the Wii Remote gives unprecedented control over the minions. For example, individual Minions can be plucked from the horde, held by the neck and then, by vigorously shaking the Wii Remote, throttled to imbue him with some Overlordly power and turn him into a manic minion missile. With a now-explosive body, the insane little critter can be guided into enemies with hilarious, if rather fatal, consequences. Backed by a rich, tongue-in-cheek story from award-winning games author Rhianna Pratchett, the game features Overlord favourites including Halflings, trolls, elves, and dwarves and introduces wicked witches, gingerbread men and Lil' Red Riding Hood, the seeming sweet girl with a very personal lupine secret.","title":"Overlord: Dark Legend","system":"wii","box_front":"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/bigboxshots/3/952373_110825_front.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Nintendo Wii","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action Adventure > Fantasy","id":"61323","developer":"Climax Group"},{"rating":{},"description":"Controlling a mysterious figure who has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord's Dark Tower.

You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander.

Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip.

From excited citizens to the traffic on the streets, every detail of this vibrant city has a mind of its own. These 80 square miles are brought to life for the first time in a videogame. Go anywhere and do anything in Metropolis as Superman. Non-linear gameplay allows you to explore and play the game exactly how you want to at your own pace. Where and how you fly - to the top of skyscrapers, dodging elevated trains - is completely up to you, since gameplay is designed as a true open world experience. With notorious villains like Metallo and colossal challenges only Superman can overcome, you must navigate the Man of Steel to monitor and protect Metropolis from destruction. Three distinct types of gameplay -- Flying, Rescue, and Combat -- will keep the action constant and the challenges relentless. Play both film-inspired missions as well as original content created exclusively for the videogame. Graphics, sound, and gameplay have been taken to the next level to create a Metropolis like you've never seen it, with three dimensional sound, a complete orchestra soundtrack, and Oscar-wining sound designer.","title":"Superman Returns","system":"xbox","box_front":"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/bigboxshots/3/930273_70688_front.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Xbox","esrb_rating":"T","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up > Action","id":"47587","developer":"EA Tiburon"},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Superman Returns","system":"ds","box_front":{},"box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Nintendo DS","esrb_rating":"Everyone","genre":"Action","id":"99298","developer":"Santa Cruz Games"},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Superman Returns","system":"xbox360","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1212874611-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Xbox 360","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99299","developer":"EA Tiburon"},{"rating":{},"description":"Superman: Man of Steel is an Action game, developed and published by Tynesoft,  which was released in Europe in 1989.","title":"Superman: Man of Steel","system":"bbc","box_front":"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/bigboxshots/1/950791_108002_front.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"BBC Micro","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action > General","id":"2665","developer":"Tynesoft"},{"rating":{},"description":"Assume the role of Superman as he tries to avert disaster in Metropolis.

You're about to tee off on a course so challenging that it would've had history's greatest golfers trembling in their knickers. Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars.

For thousands of years, their vast mental capabilities have been focused upon one goal: the conquest of the universe! To accomplish this, they are creating huge armies of robo-mutants - bizarre creatures, half robot and half living flesh. With their seven manufacturing bases producing thousands of robo-mutants each day, the Burai armies will soon overrun the galaxy - unless you can stop them! Strap on your proton pack, charge up your laser cannon, and prepare to do battle with the deadliest army of mutant rogues in the universe.

This world of the distant future has once again flourished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet. These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or center, of the eight nuclear explosions  which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again! The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the 8 Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards. Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth.

At every turn, you're challenged by bloodthirsty enemy defenses, including tanks, copters, machine gun fire and mines. Use 150mm shells, 50 caliber machine guns, smoke bombs and wire-guided missiles to defend yourself and complete your orders. Launch full-scale attacks on heavily-defended enemy strongholds that include a train yard, a refinery and a nuclear power plant.

The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the world from his scourge of evil!","title":"Crystalis","system":"nes","box_front":"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/bigboxshots/9/587209_49864_front.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"NES","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Role-Playing > Action RPG","id":"4019","developer":"SNK"},{"rating":{},"description":"Crystalis is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Nintendo,  which was released in 2000.","title":"Crystalis","system":"gbc","box_front":{},"box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Game Boy Color","esrb_rating":"E","genre":"Role-Playing > General","id":"34966","developer":"Nintendo"}]},"_id":"XHakXy6pP3Lx3LGn"}

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six &quot;G&quot; vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines.

After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet &quot;Stalking&quot; Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"nes","box_front":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/data.archive.vg/images/games/5459/1xukg_original.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"NES","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Beat-'Em-Up > Action","id":"5459","developer":"Konami"},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"cpc","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Amstrad CPC","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99801","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"ast","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Atari ST","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99802","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game ","system":"arcade","box_front":{},"box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Arcade","esrb_rating":{},"genre":{},"id":"107719","developer":"Konami (Nintendo of America license)"},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"amiga","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Amiga","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99800","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"c64","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Commodore 64 ","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99803","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"pc","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"PC","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99804","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"xbox360","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Xbox 360","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99805","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"sinclair","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Sinclair ZX81/Spectrum","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99806","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."}]},"_id":"hHG8jG49CJEQBY1P"}

That pleasant little camp where happy children of all ages go to spend a fun-filled summer... but this summer will be different. The fun will have to wait. Jason has decided to come to camp and terror is the only game they'll be playing. Only you can stop this terror. You and your six camp counselors can prevent Jason from running wild. It's not an easy task. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood-sucking bats, and hordes of mindless zombies at every turn. If a friend is in danger it's up to you to help... or else you can just kiss them goodbye. Jason doesn't play favorites. He'll take anyone. Don't think that hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe will keep you safe. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason, face to face, and destroy him.

Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare","system":"gamecube","box_front":"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/bigboxshots/5/928275_67332_front.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"GameCube","esrb_rating":"E10+","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up > Action","id":"46245","developer":"Konami"},{"rating":{},"description":{},"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game","system":"cpc","box_front":"http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/small/1158673453-00.jpg","box_front_small":{},"system_title":"Amstrad CPC","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Action","id":"99801","developer":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"rating":{},"description":"Be your favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and master your ninja skills in their action-packed world.

A marble can be moved into an adjacent hole;\n2. Or a marble can jump over one marble of any color in any direction to a symmetrical position on the opposite side, provided the hole beyond the jumped marble is vacant. Multiple jumps are allowed.\nThe marbles may be moved in and out of any holes on the board.

The one hole in the center of the board is left unoccupied so that the game board starts out with a symmetrical hexagonal pattern. The players take turns jumping any marbles over other marbles on the board. The jumped over pieces are captured and collected in the player&#39;s bin. If no jump is left, a marble can be moved into an adjacent hole until capture can be done. The Last marble is belonged to the player who captured the second-last marble.","title":"(Int'l) Chinese Checkers","system":"iphone","box_front":{},"box_front_small":{},"system_title":"iPhone","esrb_rating":{},"genre":"Miscellaneous > Board Games","id":"65007","developer":"PLAY More Limited"},{"rating":{},"description":"Battle Chinese Checkers is a Simple & Fun classic board game!Chinese checkers is a classic board game that can be played by two to six people!

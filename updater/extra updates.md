# Updating ignition/node_modules, emulators, EmulatorCores

To update these folders a file named "extra.sh" is required in the root of the ignition folder in the ignition.zip update folder.

This file requires the information to update the other bits of Ignition but shouldn't be used to update Ignition itself other than the node_modules.

This file need to be a bash file called "extra.sh" to be run by the updater script.
